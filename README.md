- To evaluate the parameters of the subject who generated the "experiment motion" by seeing if a matched trajectory is able to be generated by the trajectory optimization progress with the parameters set.

- The OpenSim-Matlab interface used in the optimization progress is adapted from Brian Umberger & Leng-Feng Lee's work in 2015, form UMass Amherst.
